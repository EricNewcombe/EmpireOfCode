Crystal Row

A crystal or crystalline solid is a solid material whose constituents, such as atoms, molecules or ions, are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure, forming a crystal lattice that extends in all directions. The scientific definition of a "crystal" is based on the microscopic arrangement of atoms inside it, called the crystal structure. A crystal is a solid where the atoms form a periodic arrangement.

Because crystals are such an important resource, systems must be put in place to check the crystal quality during the growth and harvest periods. For our initial tests, we use random spot checks on the atomic lines composing each of the crystals. This crystal type contains two atoms composed of the elements "X" (Xenatom) and "Z" (Zorium). In a well grown crystal, these atoms should alternate down the atomic line.

You are given a random atomic line from a sample crystal lattice as a sequence of the letters "X" and "Z". A good line should have the periodic arrangement (one by one) looking like ["X", "Z", "X", "Z"]. If any atoms neighbor another of the same element, then this crystal is of no use to us and should be discarded.

X - Z - X - Z - X - Z Good
Z - X - Z - X - Z - X Good
Z - X - X - Z - X - Z Bad
Z - X - Z - Z - Z - X Bad
Rows

Input: Atomic lines as a list of strings.

Output: The crystal quality as a boolean.

Example:

checkLine(["X", "Z", "X"]) == true
checkLine(["X", "Z", "X", "X"]) == false
Precondition:

1 < |line| ≤ 1000

∀ x ∈ line: x='X' OR x='Z'

This is first simple data structure and here you can learn how to work with a list. It's a simple concept which you can solve by just pausing to think.
