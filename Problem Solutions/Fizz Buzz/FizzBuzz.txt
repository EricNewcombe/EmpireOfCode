Fizz Buzz

To get them ready for storage, we need the worker-bots to sort crystals by 3 or 5 or divide them by the number of edges. To make things easier, we will base our program on the ancient human word game "Fizz buzz".

Our goal is to write a function that will receive a positive integer and return:

The phrase "Fizz Buzz" if the number is divisible by 3 and by 5,

The word "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3,

The word "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5,

The number as a string for all other cases.

Input: A number as an integer.

Output: The answer as a string.

Example:

fizzBuzz(15) === "Fizz Buzz"
fizzBuzz(6) === "Fizz"
fizzBuzz(5) === "Buzz"
fizzBuzz(7) === "7"
Precondition:

0 < number â‰¤ 1000
