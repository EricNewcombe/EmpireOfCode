Simple Areas

To increase our storage capacity we should start with calculating the area of the rooms we have available.

You should write a function to calculate the area of simple figures: circles, rectangles and triangles. You are given an arbitrary number of arguments which the function should use to calculate the area for the different figures.

One argument -- The diameter of a circle and you need calculate the area of the circle.
Two arguments -- The side lengths of a rectangle and you need calculate the area of the rectangle.
Three arguments -- The lengths of each side on a triangle and you need calculate the area of the triangle.
The result should be given with two digit precision like so: +-0.01

Input: One, two or three arguments as numbers.

Output: The area of the circle, the rectangle or the triangle as a number.

Example:

simpleAreas(3) == 7.07
simpleAreas(2, 2) == 4
simpleAreas(2, 3) == 6
simpleAreas(3, 5, 4) == 6
simpleAreas(1.5, 2.5, 2) == 1.5
Precondition:

0 < len(args) <= 3
all(0 < x <= 1000 for x in args)
For the "triangle" cases, the sum of the lengths of any two sides always exceeds the length of the third side.

How it is used:

Python can be an useful tool for mathematics and science due to its simplicity, readability and ease of use.
