Index Power

Each level of the mine requires energy in exponential quantities for each device. Hmm, how to calculate this?

You are given an array with positive numbers and a number N. You should find the N-th power of the element in the array with the index N. If N is outside of the array, then return -1. Don't forget that the first element has the index 0.

Let's look at a few examples:

array = [1, 2, 3, 4] and N = 2, then the result is 32 == 9;
array = [1, 2, 3] and N = 3, but N is outside of the array, so the result is -1.
Input: An array of numbers and a number as an integer.

Output: The result as an integer.

Example:

indexPower([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) === 9
indexPower([1, 3, 10, 100], 3) === 1000000
indexPower([0, 1], 0) === 1
indexPower([1, 2], 3) === -1
Precondition:

0 < |array| ≤ 10

0 ≤ N

∀ x ∈ array: 0 ≤ x ≤ 100
